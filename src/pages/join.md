## Why Join a Co-op?

Working with an engineering co-op can be a good fit for an engineer in any stage
of their career, depending on their goals. With a co-op, statistically you're
more likely to have your job, should you still want it, after five years,
because co-ops are both more likely than "traditional" businesses to survive
over any length of time, and also co-ops are less likely to lay off staff than
"traditional" businesses over any length of time.

For 508.dev, our co-op philosophy goes much further than that. We believe that
there's an opportunity for both our engineers and our clients in the fact that
all of our competition is overcharging their clients and underpaying their
engineers. By organizing ourselves as a co-op, we can get better engineering for
our clients, at more competitive rates, while getting more fair pay for our
engineers and helping excellent engineers stand out from the crowds of other
offshore engineers, creating a true win-win situation.

Delivering for clients isn't enough. Our goal is also to grow our engineers,
with the long term objective of developing our own software products in-house,
so as to build a stable platform of income that allows us to experiment even
further.

Regardless of your skill level, or even if you have no project experience at all
and are just interested in becoming an engineer, we'd like to talk. Take a look
at our [values](https://wiki.508.dev/s/values), and if they match with yours,
send us an email at `hello@508.dev`. Or, take a look at some of our
[open source projects](https://wiki.508.dev/s/foss-project-index), to see how
you can get involved. We also have a
[wiki article](https://wiki.508.dev/s/how-to-contribute-to-a-508-project) on the
subject.

## How to Join 508.dev

508.dev is non-traditional. We don't have any full-time roles (yet). All of our
"employees" (revenue-generating co-op members) are contractors for the LLC, and
thus subcontractors for our clients.

In order to subcontract through 508.dev, the community needs to understand your
skillset and abilities. That means "joining" the co-op, which really just means
joining our Discord server and hanging out. To join our Discord server, you
first need to fill out our [intake form](https://forms.gle/ecyp49aEugS75Dhf9). A
508 member will be in touch when we have capacity to consider new members. Then,
you'll be asked to make a semi-trivial contribution to the co-op, either to one
of our FOSS projects, our blog, or in some other way. You can learn more about
the contribution requirement on our
[wiki](https://wiki.508.dev/s/contributing-to-508). If you want to explore this,
email <hello@508.dev>

## What Does it Mean to be a Member of 508.dev?

508.dev is a community as well as an actual corporation. To be a "member" means
you are known to other members and probably are in our Discord server. We don't
have membership tiers, hierarchies, etc. We do, however, have consensus
authority mechanisms, which for now is as simple as, if you have moved revenue
through 508.dev (or are currently subcontracting and will move revenue soon),
you have the right to veto 508.dev initiatives. We have roughly adopted the
consensus strategy of
[Food Not Bombs](https://foodnotbombs.net/CONSENSUS_FLOW_CHART.pdf), and our
hierarchy is similar to that of
[Valve's](https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/apps/valve/Valve_NewEmployeeHandbook.pdf).

Members are invited to participate in open source projects so as to further
develop their portfolio, or, propose their own projects so as to get assistance
developing a project that's too large to work on as an individual. Members are
invited to ask questions of other members, especially on topics you may not be
that experienced in, but another member is experienced in. A large goal of
508.dev is the professional development of all its members. As we develop
eachother further, we open up more client opportunities.

## Values

All 508.dev members agree to operate according to our values, which can be
[viewed on our wiki](https://wiki.508.dev/s/values). Our values are the basis by
which members can veto initiatives, members, or even clients, so it's critical
every member understands them deeply.
